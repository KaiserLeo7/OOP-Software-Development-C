1.The difference between internal and external linkage using examples from your code

Using keyword extern to direct the program to the existance of the INITIAL variable in another .cpp file.

extern int INITIAL;

The keyword static allows for the value of a variable to last in its scope the duration of the program.

2.The execution effect of the code in the process() function that creates the String object
which is inserted into standard output (which member function(s) does this code call)

Process.cpp creates the String class and then uses the friend overloaded operator << to output the courses

3.The changes that you made in updating your String class

To update the String class to be able to accept any length courses I first removed the MAX definition, and m_course became a char*,
then in the .cpp file we needed to get the length of the incoming course, allocate new memory for it using that length, 
and use a simple for loop to copy the incoming course into the newly allocated memory m_course.
